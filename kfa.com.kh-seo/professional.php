<h2>Professional and Ethical Standard</h2>
<p>KFA believes that a strong ethical foundation to our business best practices is a key success factor. In addition to our ethical standards as “Trust – Professional – Transparency”, we are also following and abiding the Global Professional and Ethical Standards by Royal Institute of Surveyor (RICS). The five key standards are as below:</p>
<h4>&#8226; Act with integrity</h4>
<p>Be honest and straightforward in all that we do.</p>
<h4>&#8226; Always provide a high standard of service</h4>
<p>Always ensure our client, or others to whom we have a professional responsibility, receive the best possible advice, support or performance of the terms of engagement we have agreed to.</p>
<h4>&#8226; Act in a way that promotes trust in the profession </h4>
<p>Act in a manner, both in our professional life and private life, to promote ourselves, our company or the organization we work for in a professional and positive way.</p>
<h4>&#8226; Treat others with respect </h4>
<p>Treat everyone with courtesy, politeness and respect and consider cultural sensitivities and business practices.</p>
<h4>&#8226; Take responsibility </h4>
<p>Be accountable for all our actions - don't blame others if things go wrong, and if we suspect something isn't right, be prepared to take action</p>
