<h5>HOW TO GET STARTEDIN PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT</h5>
<p>Many realestate investors are keen to step upto the next level and get involved In property development.</p>
They think "i'll buy a block ofland or old house,pull it down and build  a number oftownhouses,units or apartments. And then maybe I'llsell some,keep some and move onto the next project."It all sounds so simple.
<p>But there is a lot moretothe development process than what you see happening on site. In fact most of the success of any property development is underwritten long before you commence construction.You see."property developers follow a sequence of steps from the moment they first conceive a 
project to the timethey complete the physical construction and begin ongoingasset management. Whilethe sequence may vary slightly,usually the development is broken up intothe following elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Coming upwiththeidea</li>
    <li>Refining it</li>
    <li>Testing Its feasibility</li>
    <li>Negotiatingcontracts</li>
    <li>Makinga formal commitment</li>
    <li>Constructingthe project</li>
    <li>Completing the project andfinally</li>
    <li>Managing the new project</li>
</ul>
<strong>THE ATTRIBUTES OF SUCCESSFUL PROPERTY DEVELOPERS</strong>
<p>In these changingtimes when property investors can no longer count on double digit price growth many are considering getting started in property development to helpthem 'manufacture' some capital growth.</p>
<strong>So what exactly Is property development?</strong>   
<p>To me It Is the continual reconfiguration of the built environment to meet society's needs.Houses,apartments, office buildings,shopping complexes, road and sewers don't just happen.Somebody must mot­ ivate and manage the creation and eventually the recreation of the spaces in which we live,work and play.The need for development is constant because of our massive population growth and the changing tastes of how we want to live. Interestingly our population recently ticketed over to 15 million people and it took us over 200 years to get to this size.Yet it's likely our populationwill almost double again to 40 million people by 2050.While this will cause numerous of social,financial and infrastructure challenges itwill also create some amazing opportunities for the property development Industry.</p>
<strong>So what makes a good property developer?</strong>
<p>Successful property developers aren't born and they're definitely not created overnight.Their success comes from a combination of attitude, experience,education, instinct andthe lessons learned from both victories and failures. Property development ls an extremely creative process. Successfulproperty developers area bit like movie producers.They take a project from the conceptionofan Idea insomebody's mindthrough the designandapproval phase,financing, construction, marketingandthen eventuallythe leasing or saleof the project.Developers assemble a highly talented team of people and skillfully lead them to develop a profitable outcome,which means they need to be proactive and make things happen. They must also be creative,flexible and adaptive to take their project through this maze.Developers needto work hard,have patience,remain focused and have a burningdetermination to succeed.Whilethe process of property development can bea lot offun,it is not without some painand  considerable risk.When all goes well the results are fantastic but Ifthings go wrong, they really  gowrong.Developers follow a sequenceofsteps from the moment they first conceive a projectto the time they complete the physical construction</p>
<strong>While the sequence may vary slightly,usually the development is broken up intothe following elements:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Coming upwith the idea</li>
    <li>Refiningit</li>
    <li>Testingits feasibility</li>
    <li>Negotiatingcontracts</li>
    <li>Making a formal commitment</li>
    <li>Obtaining development approval</li>
    <li>Formalizing building contracts and specifications</li>
    <li>Constructing the project</li>
    <li>Completingthe project and finally</li>
    <li>Managingthe new project</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way they will need to negotiate with real estate agents, banks, financiers, councils, neighbours,consultants, owner occupiersandtenants. A good developer must be a big picturethinker,but must know when it's important to take care of the details.</p>    
<strong>Who becomes a property developer?</strong>    
<p>Any one get can get started in property development. While the big development projects are usually constructed by large corporations, manyofthemedium density developments inthesuburbs of our capital city are run by part time property developers who have a "Rreal" full timejob. Some are In property related industries such as builders,architects or estate agents, but many are "ordlnary" successful property Investors who are now looking at development to fast track their wealth.</p>    
<stron>Do you have the right attributes?</stron>    
<p>While a property developer does not need to have intimate knowledge of all aspects of the development process, he must have a good under­ standingof the economy,property markets, the town planning process, buildingconstruction and finance so he can assemble a proficlentteam around 
himand manage them with credibilty. Before gettinginvolved in property development, be honest and ask yourself:</p>    
<ul>
    <li>Do Ihave suffident general property investment and market experience?</li>
    <li>Do Ihave the knowledge required to undertake a development?</li>
    <li>Have Iassembled a good team around me?</li>
    <li>Do Ihavethetime requiredto mange the project?</li>
    <li>Do Ihave deep enough pockets? Property development always seems to take more money thanyou Initially think.</li>
    </ul>    
<p>While property development can be very lucrative, many beginning property developers get themselves in to trouble because they don't know what they don't know.</p>
